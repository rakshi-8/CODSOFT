Task 2 - Image Captioning 🖼️📝

📌 Internship: CodSoft AI Internship - July Batch B37  
👩‍💻 Intern: Rakshitha S  

✅ Project Description:
This project generates meaningful captions for images using deep learning. It uses a pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) for feature extraction and an LSTM model for caption generation.

🔧 Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- InceptionV3
- LSTM
- NLP & Deep Learning

▶️ How to Run:bash
python image_captioning.py
